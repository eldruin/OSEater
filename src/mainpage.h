/** \mainpage OSEater Documentation
 * \par Description:
 * OSEater is a "Pac-Man" like game in which "Tux", the Linux pet
 * has to collect all the dots in the map avoiding the Windows logos.
 * There also exist Apple logos that when they are eaten by Tux the
 * game mode is changed and the hero can eat the Windows logos.
 * Many thanks to the freesound.org project and to the user HardPCM
 * for creating the sounds I've used in this game.
 *
 * \par
 * It's developed for the LPC2378-STK board from Olimex, based on the
 * LPC2378 microcontroller from NXP which has an ARM architecture.
 * The peripherals used are the built in screen, joystick and digital 
 * to analog converter to play sounds.
 *
 * \par Design:
 * OSEater follows an object oriented design using a component based
 * metodology in C++ programming language.
 * Due to the strong hardware limitations and my own C/C++ knowledge,
 * the code is not as beautiful as it could be.
